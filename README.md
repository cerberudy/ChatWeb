# ChatWeb
# In client.py, you can enter the IP number and port number that you opened with the tunnel service in the client.connect section.
# for example
# '0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io' , 13296
# the tunnel service you opened should stay open until the chat is over
# You need to send the tunnel service ip and port number you have opened to other people.
# other users don't need tunnel service. It is enough to put your connection information in the places I mentioned in client.py.
# every user must run server.py first "python3 server.py"
# You can then start chatting by running client.py "python3 client.py"
